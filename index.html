    <h1>My Dearest Oriaku,</h1>
    
    <p>Will you be my Valentine?</p>

    <p>Now, before you answer, let me list a few reasons why this is a fantastic idea:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I promise to share my snacks with you (even the last slice of pizza, if I’m feeling generous).</li>
      <li>I’ll laugh at your jokes, even the ones that aren’t funny.</li>
      <li>I’ll even let you win at Mortal Kombat… maybe.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In return, all I ask is that you tolerate my weirdness, my occasional awkwardness, 
       and my inability to decide what to eat for dinner.</p>

    <p>So, what do you say? Will you be my Valentine and make this February 14th the cheesiest, 
       most love-filled day of the year? I promise it’ll be fun, full of laughter, and maybe even a little bit of chocolate.</p>
